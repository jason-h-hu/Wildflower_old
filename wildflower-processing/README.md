# Wildflower Processing Client
WildflowerClient contains code for a Processing sketch implementation of a Wildflower Client.
It depends on [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) and [Processing Websockets](https://github.com/alexandrainst/processing_websockets). These are not bundled, but can be downloaded and their `.jar` files can be added to a directory `code` immediately underneath `WildflowerClient` in order to run.
