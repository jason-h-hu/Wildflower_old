Wildflower is a sandbox game about creatures. Creatures in wildflower are controlled by Agents, which are programs written by Wildflower players. Agents must interact with the [Wildflower HTTP API](https://github.com/jason-h-hu/Wildflower/wiki/Wildflower-HTTP-Api-for-Agents) in order to manipulate their Creature, and observe the Wildflower World through its eyes.
